# Yen-s-k-shortest-paths-algorithm
The implementation of Yen's k-shortest paths algorithm on Python with NetworkX. This implementation is suitable for Graph and Digraph.

In graph theory, Yen's algorithm computes single-source K-shortest loopless paths for a graph with non-negative edge cost. The algorithm was published by Jin Y. Yen in 1971 and employs any shortest path algorithm to find the best path, then proceeds to find K âˆ’ 1 deviations of the best path.
